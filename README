I. DESCRIPTION

  TCLink is a thin client library to allow your e-commerce servers to
connect to the TrustCommerce payment gateway easily and consistently.
The protocol (which is the same across all platforms and languages) is
well-documented in the Web Developer's Guide, so please consult it for
any questions you may have about the protocol syntax itself.


II. LICENSE

  TCLink for Ruby is released under the GNU LGPL.  Please read LICENSE
for details.


III. REQUIREMENTS

  You need to have the OpenSSL development libraries installed.  It
is recommended that you use the latest version provided by the vendor
for PCI reasons.

  Besides the normal Ruby install, you'll need the ruby-devel package,
which contains files needed for building Ruby extensions.

IV. INSTALLATION

  [sudo] gem install tclink

V. TESTING

    ruby tctest.rb

  This script will run a test transaction and print the results.

VI. USAGE

  The tctest.rb script shows a simple example of running transactions
through the TCLink API.  For further information, please consult the TC
Developer's Guide, located in the doc subdirectory.

VII. NOTE

I packaged this up as a gem for my own uses. I am not affiliated with
Trust Commerce and have not modified any of the C code.

If you have trouble building this, you can download a tarball of the source
from Trust Commerce's vault.
